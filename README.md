# Jubs-CLI
A bash script to open different links (I use it as a CLI tool by placing it in my path)

For example, if this script is placed in `PATH` then typing this into the terminal does:

`jubs messenger` - opens facebook messenger

`jubs gmail` - opens gmail

`jubs linkedin_search fistname lastname` - does a linkedin search on "firstname" and "lastname" on linkedin
